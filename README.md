# Introduction
> Xianbin Lin is a iOS developer at Kizoa company - one of the most amazing online video editor. The major work for him is to build an iOS application which allows users to create videos with 3D transitions and effects on their iOS devices and share the videos with their family and friends.

> Xianbin Lin is a bright, aggressive and self-motivated software engineer who came to France in 2010. He has studied in the embedded system for 5 years and he has worked as an iOS developer for more than one year.

> The passion for becoming an iOS developer can be traced back to 7 years ago. When I bought my first iPhone and MacBook, the iOS system gave me a great user experience, it simplified and organized my file as well as a nurse. So I wanted to create great iOS applications to help people, and I started to learn iOS programming during my school days.

> I am a good developer, I like to code, I find it enjoyable. I like to try different tools which help us to make programming more efficient and safe. I like to research programming architecture to make the code more clear and reusable. I like to learn project management tools that help us to organize projects and controller projects timing.

> I have a big love of learning, I canâ€™t stop thinking of solving problems and new technologies. I like to participate in discussions with colleagues and also I would like to share my knowledge to people. I want to know how things work deep in my bones and I am happy about how fast I improve my technical skills.

> Outside of the office, I play mobile games and video game like Diablo III. I do research in big data analytics using Python, machine learning using TensorFlow, performance in the backend server using Golang language and any other new technologies. Sometimes I would like to travel to beach cities, rent a good apartment and have some nice days.
